# MotionAnalyser

**MotionAnalyser** is a GUI designed to facilitate the handling, preprocessing, and analysis of motion tracking data. It is designed to streamline the characterization of movements in 3D space widely used in disciplines such as sport, physiotherapy, and behavioral science.

**MotionAnalyser** is written in `MATLAB` and will be released upon publication of the accompanying manuscript. It will be available as source code, packaged app, and standalone installer. Fore more information, read the [user manual](docs/UserManual.pdf) or browse the [wiki](https://github.com/BoullandLab/MotionAnalyser/wiki) (under construction)

A MATLAB application package, as well as standalone installers for Windows and Linux, can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/BoullandLab/MotionAnalyser/releases) page.
